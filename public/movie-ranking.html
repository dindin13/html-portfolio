<h1>The Best Movies According to Dindin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Taare Zameen Par</h3>
    <p>I have learned about this movie during one of my classes that I have attended to, which is about children with special needs.<br />
    This was the very first Bollywood movie that I've watched. <br />
    I loved it because one of the main characters, which was the Art Teacher, has the heart for that one student who had difficulties in learning all of his subjects due to dyslexia. <br />
    That teacher helped and supported him until he became good at reading and writing and he got to discover what specific gift that boy has.</p>

<h3>Ballerina</h3>
    <p>I loved this animated movie because it showed hope about reaching once dream is never impossible once you've committed yourself in making that dream a reality.</p>

<h3>Sweet and Sour</h3>
    <p>This one is a Korean movie. And what I loved about it is, it happens even in relationships. <br />
        The movie  emphasized that life isn't about finding your one true love, but rather about the effort and commitment that is required if you want your relationship to succeed.
